# Front-End Template

A template for building static websites powered by gulp and webpack.

## Requirements

```bash
$ nvm install # or nvm i
```

Also, make sure that [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed since some scripts depend on it.

## Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # or yarn
```

## Usage

### Development

```bash
# serve with live/hot reloading at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

### Production

```bash
# build for production
$ npm run build # or yarn build
```
